libburn/sg.c
Hopefully fixed a file descriptor resource leak in sg_grab().
All scanned drives (seem to) stay open once, the grabbed one got re-opened
and its stored first file descriptor got forgotten. Now we try to detect
and re-use the still open fd.

cdrskin/cdrskin.c [committed later as revision 11]
O_EXCL experiments imported from cdrskin-0.1.3
In default configuration and on compliant kernels expect that a busy drive is
invisible to further cdrskin instances. The user gets hints in case of empty
bus scan result resp. busy drive given with dev=...
Wether cdrecord and cdrskin respect each other would have to be evaluated.
Options to play with:
 --demand_a_drive   exit !=0 on bus scans with empty result
 --drive_abort_on_busy  abort process if busy drive is found
                    (might be triggered by a busy hard disk)
 --drive_blocking   try to wait for busy drive to become free
                    (might be stalled by a busy hard disk)
 --drive_not_exclusive  do not ask kernel to prevent opening
                    busy drives. Effect is kernel dependend.
 grab_drive_and_wait=<num>  grab drive, wait given number of
                    seconds, release drive, and do normal work

cdrskin/wiki_plain.txt 
The initial filling of the cdrskin wiki on libburn.pykix.org .
I am not sure about the future fate of this text. I plan to keep it up to
date with the online wiki for now. The online version will be considered
the original.
