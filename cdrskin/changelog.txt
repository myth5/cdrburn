cdrskin/changelog.txt
cdrskin-0.1.5 development started.
Introduced this changelog.
---------------------------------- Format (still emerging):

Day Month Year [eventual commit mark with revision number]
affected files , naked, one by line, 
[eventually = internal snapshot tarball]
More ore less concise description.

---------------------------------- End of Format

20 Aug 2006  [committed together with next change, i fear]
libburn/sg.c
Hopefully fixed a file descriptor resource leak in sg_grab().
All scanned drives (seem to) stay open once, the grabbed one got re-opened
and its stored first file descriptor got forgotten. Now we try to detect
and re-use the still open fd.

21 Aug 2006  [committed]
libburn/libburn.h
libburn/sg.c
libburn/init.c
= libburn_cdrskin_A60819.tgz
cdrskin/cdrskin.c [committed later as revision 11]
O_EXCL experiments imported from cdrskin-0.1.3
In default configuration and on compliant kernels expect that a busy drive is
invisible to further cdrskin instances. The user gets hints in case of empty
bus scan result resp. busy drive given with dev=...
Wether cdrecord and cdrskin respect each other would have to be evaluated.
Options to play with:
 --demand_a_drive   exit !=0 on bus scans with empty result
 --drive_abort_on_busy  abort process if busy drive is found
                    (might be triggered by a busy hard disk)
 --drive_blocking   try to wait for busy drive to become free
                    (might be stalled by a busy hard disk)
 --drive_not_exclusive  do not ask kernel to prevent opening
                    busy drives. Effect is kernel dependend.
 grab_drive_and_wait=<num>  grab drive, wait given number of
                    seconds, release drive, and do normal work

21 Aug 2006  [committed]

21 Aug 2006  [committed 12]
cdrskin/wiki_plain.txt 
The initial filling of the cdrskin wiki on libburn.pykix.org .
I am not sure about the future fate of this text. I plan to keep it up to
date with the online wiki for now. The online version will be considered
the original.

21 Aug 2006 [committed 15]
